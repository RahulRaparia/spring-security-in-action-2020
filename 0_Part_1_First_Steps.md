# First Steps
In chapter 1, we start by discussing the place of security in the development process of an application. Then, in chapter 2, I introduce you to the basic components of Spring Securityâ€™s backbone architecture by implementing a few straightforward projects.

The purpose of this part is to get you started with Spring Security, especially if you are just beginning to learn this framework. However, even if you already know some aspects of application-level security and the underlying architecture of Spring Security, I recommend you read this part as a refresher.
